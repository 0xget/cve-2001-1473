We employed a novel approach to an age-old vulnerability in the SSH-1 protocol, as described by CVE-2001-1473. 
This vulnerability enables a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) server to intercept an SSH-1 session between a client and a vulnerable server, 
potentially exposing the user’s private key. However, executing a practical attack necessitates the client’s usage of the attacking server 
as a hopping node and granting permission for unknown server keys, significantly increasing the complexity of a successful exploit.

Our adaptation of the original attack method enables the extraction of the SSH server’s private key itself, 
offering access to the vulnerable server with sshd permissions. 
Notably, this modified approach eliminates the MITM requirement and can be executed directly against the vulnerable server.
